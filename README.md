# Pathfinding-project
## Discrete math


* Introduction.


This project implements an algorithm for finding the shortest path between two points on the surface.
Pathfinder algorithms are essential because they are used in applications such as Google Maps, satellite navigation systems, and packet routing over the Internet. The use of path search algorithms is not limited to navigation systems. The general idea can be applied to other applications, such as computer games. In games, as in life, we often want to find ways from one place to another, with the shortest distance. In such cases, it would be advisable to take into account travel time. There are several algorithms for finding the shortest distance between two points on the surface. The most popular of these are the Dijkstra algorithms and the A * algorithm. Algorithm A * improves Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm, including additional information using a heuristic function that determines which paths should be explored next. Thanks to this optimization, the shortest paths are found faster. Algorithm A * can be used to find the shortest paths between individual pairs of places where GPS coordinates are known.

Algorithm A * is implemented in Python. The algorithm is divided into smaller subtasks. Using the methods of functional decomposition

* Pseudocode
